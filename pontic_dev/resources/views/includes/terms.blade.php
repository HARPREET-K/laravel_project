Materials may be made available on or through the Site by third parties not within our control. It is our policy not to permit materials known by us to be infringing to remain on or available through the Site. Please notify us promptly if you believe that any materials on or available through the Site infringe on your intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of anyone else. Once we receive proper notice of claimed infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), we will respond promptly to remove the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the content at issue. When notifying us of potential infringement, you must include the following:
    <br />
	<br />

    <li>identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works, then a representative list of such works on the Site;</li>
    <li>identification of the supposedly infringing material that is to be removed;</li>
    <li>information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on the Site;</li>
    <li>contact information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, or email address;</li>
    <li>a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material is in fact infringing and/or not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
    <li>a statement that, under penalty of perjury, the information in the notification is accurate and where relevant that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; and </li>
    <li>the signature, physical or electronic, of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on his or her behalf.</li>
</ol>
    <br />
	<br />
A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification. To file a counter notification with us, please provide the DMCA Agent a written communication containing the following:
    <br />
	<br />
<ol>
    <li>identification of the supposedly infringing material that is to be removed;</li>

<br />

     <div class="privPoliHead">TYPES OF Information Collected</div>
     <ol>
        <li>Personally Identifiable Information: We may collect Personally Identifiable Information when you interact and provide such information on our Site such as, but not limited to, when creating a Member Profile or submitting content to the Site. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that specific person whether from that data or from that data and other information to which Pontic has or is likely to have access. Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person. Personally Identifiable Information also does not include information that you post on the Site that is available to other Members (excluding private communications). The types of Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site will vary based on the Services offered on the Site, but may include, among other things, your name, address, phone number, birth date, billing and delivery information, email address, credit card or other financial account information, and demographic information (e.g., gender, marital status).
        </li>

        </li>
     </ol>
     <div class="privPoliHead">How Information is Collected and Used and Shared </div>
       <ol>
            <li>Information Provided: Pontic collects and saves information that you upload to the Site or provide in connection with your use of the Services.

            <li>Tracking Technologies: Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Pontic and our marketing partners, affiliates, or services providers of analytics or online customer support. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as on an aggregated basis. The types of non-personal data collected on our Site through the use of these, and other tools as Pontic may add from time to time, may include: the search terms you used, new or returning user information, browser information, computer type, operating system, internet service providers, website usage, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, ads viewed, etc. Additionally, cookies, tags and other tools placed by third parties may collect other information about you such as, but not limited to, your industry, company size, job function, seniority level, etc.)(collectively, all of the foregoing data, the "Non-Personal Data").

We use cookies for content personalization, analytics/performance, functional purposes, as well as the ability to access secure areas of our Site. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Site may be limited.
            </li>
            
            <li>Log Files: As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
            </li>
            
            <li>Third Parties: We may receive information about you from individuals or corporate entities that use the Services. We may receive information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, subcontractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, payment processing websites) and may receive information about you from them, subject to your agreements with them.
            </li>
            
            <li>Storage: We use Local Storage (LSs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSs such as HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. 
            </li>
            
            <li>Services: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personal Data, or both as the case may be, may be used to carry out our obligations to provide you with the Services; to provide you with the information, products and additional services that you may request from us; to notify you about changes in or additions to our services; to provide you with information about goods or services we feel may interest you and to ensure that content from our Site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.
            </li>
            
            <li>Service Requests: When fulfilling service requests initiated by you, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with certain third parties to fulfill the requests.
            </li>
            
            <li>Sharing your Personally Identifiable Information With Certain Other Companies: Pontic may share, sell or rent Personally Identifiable Information, other than financial account information, with certain other companies in order to provide them an opportunity to offer products or services that may be of interest to you, which helps contribute non-transaction based revenue to Pontic. Pontic may also share Personally Identifiable Information with selected third parties, including: business partners, vendors, suppliers and subcontractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with you and to analytics providers and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of our Site.  We may share Personally Identifiable Information with our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We may also disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. Likewise if Pontic, LLC. or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party all personal data held by it about its users and Members will be one of the transferred assets. Pontic may also occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf including, but not limited to, packaging, mailing and delivering promotional offers, sweepstakes or contests, answering customer questions about products or services, consulting services, data modeling, printing, and sending postal mail. Some of these parties with whom we share Personally Identifiable Information, may store some or all of your information on servers outside of the United States. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy or in a similar, industry-standard manner, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. The use of your information by one of our trusted business partners may be subject to that party’s own privacy policy.  We cannot make any representations regarding the use or transfer of your Personally Identifiable Information or other information that we may have in the event of our bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, or an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Furthermore, we cannot and will not be responsible for any breach of security by any third parties or for any actions of any third parties that receive any of the information that is disclosed to us.

        <br />
     	<br />
        <div class="privPoliHead">DO NOT TRACK REQUESTS</div>
